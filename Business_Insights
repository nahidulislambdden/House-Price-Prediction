# Business Perspective: Boston House Price Prediction  

## 1. Problem Context  
Housing prices directly impact **real estate companies, banks, property investors, and governments**. Accurate price prediction enables:  
- **Real estate agents** → Set competitive listing prices  
- **Banks** → Assess mortgage risks  
- **Developers** → Decide investment locations  
- **Buyers & Sellers** → Negotiate using data-driven insights  

## 2. Key Insights from Data  
- **Positive correlation:**  
  - More rooms (RM) → Higher house prices  
  - Highway accessibility (RAD) → Higher property demand and value  

- **Negative correlation:**  
  - Higher crime rate (CRIM) → Reduces property values  
  - Higher % lower-status population (LSTAT) → Reduces prices  

**Business meaning:** Building or buying houses in low-crime, well-connected areas with larger rooms increases value.  

## 3. Model Reliability  
- **R² = 0.905** → Model explains ~90% of price variance  
- **MAE ≈ $2000** → Predictions are very close to actual prices  

This accuracy is acceptable for **real estate forecasting and loan approval systems**.  

## 4. Business Applications  
1. **Price Recommendation System** → Like Zillow/Redfin for buyers & sellers  
2. **Loan Risk Assessment** → Banks use predictions to set safe mortgage limits  
3. **Investment Strategy** → Developers & investors identify undervalued properties  
4. **Urban Planning** → Governments improve schools, transport, and infrastructure to raise area values  

## 5. Limitations & Ethics  
- Dataset contains **biased race-related variable (`B`)** → should not be used in production.  
- Dataset is **small & outdated (506 rows)**.  
- Market dynamics (interest rates, economy, demand shifts) are not included.  

## Business Takeaway  
The XGBoost model shows strong predictive ability (R² = 0.905, MAE ≈ $2000).  
It can **support real estate, banking, and urban planning decisions**.  
For real-world use, a larger, modern, and unbiased dataset is required.
